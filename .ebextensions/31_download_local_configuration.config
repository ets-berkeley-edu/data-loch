# The EB_ENVIRONMENT variable tells an Elastic Beanstalk environment its own name (e.g., suitec-preview-service-dev).
# Download the appropriate configuration file from the suitec-config S3 bucket and store it as local-production.json
# (since all our environments are running under NODE_ENV=production).
